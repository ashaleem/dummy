Prison sentences will be much longer and much, much more unpleasant.</p> <p>“I’m expecting great results,” councillor Elizabeth Just told <em>The Daily News</em>. She has been one the policy’s strongest advocates in recent months. “Those fat cats need to know we’re not messing around.”</p> <p>As part of a broader cultural shift, law enforcement has agreed offences like drug possession and reselling cigarettes will henceforth be met with the kind of chummy ‘oh you’ finger wagging previously reserved for war criminals and sociopathic hedge fund managers.</p> <p>Though some have expressed concern about the morality of the programme lawmakers insist it’s just a form of advanced regulation.</p>`;
