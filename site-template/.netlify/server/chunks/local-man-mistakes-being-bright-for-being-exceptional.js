Several A-graded papers and a particularly simpering teacher gave him delusions of grandeur that he has been unable to shake for more than 20 years.</p> <p>According to Whale-Line sources, Jones finally came to terms with his squandered potential (such as it was) after bumping into an old schoolmate he had previously considered dim. Though hard work and kindness she had achieved prosperity, happiness, and good prospects of early retirement.</p> <p>Due to his unfamiliarity with hard work Jones has not yet acted on this revelation.</p>`;
